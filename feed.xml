<p>So you want to design the perfect biomarker. Or perhaps you’re wondering whether a hot new biomarker (in a top journal or from a biotech start-up) is actually going to be useful, or stand the test of time. The goal of this article is to provide a framework for how to evaluate the effectiveness of biomarkers for health, disease, or really any metric. I recommend you check out the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326791/">NIH’s “BEST Resource”</a> for technical definitions. I will refer here to a biomarker as any characteristic that serves as an indicator of a biological function, state of health, or metric that reflects a health-related process. Biomarkers could be from a blood test (like serum glucose levels), imaging characteristics (from a Brain MRI or PET Scan), digital (personal history of Google queries that suggest anxiety), genetic variants (such as BRCA1 cancer risk gene), or anything you could imagine.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of a biomarker is to guide healthcare management, measure response to treatment, or provide an index of future risk. An ideal one will maximize benefits, make it clear to the person and healthcare team how to move forward with the individual’s life, be easy to measure and track, and be responsive to a specific intervention.</p>

<p>I will describe first the necessary context, then P-FRAME criteria, and finally touch on the specific indications.</p>

<h2 id="context-matters">Context Matters</h2>

<p>Clearly define the problem you are trying to solve- this concept that applies both to academic research and launching a startup. As for biomarkers, it is important to determine what problem your biomarker aims to solve. Will it help guide treatment for Alzheimer’s? Will it tell you the optimal diet to enhance sleep? Something as general as a “key health indicator” is nearly useless. This is because it does not provide any new knowledge to the individual.</p>

<p>Key questions you should begin thinking about include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If I get this biomarker tested, will it tell me how to I change my behavior?</li>
    <li>Will I be faced with decisions that could change the course of my health? </li>
    <li>If the biomarker does correlate with disease risk, does a solution exist?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bottom line is, you need to provide context along with the biomarker. A good example of a useful biomarker is VO2Max. It is the maximal rate of oxygen consumption and utilization during an exercise test, and is a gold standard biomarker for cardiorespiratory fitness. This may be a useful biomarker for an individual about to begin a new exercise program, or an Olympic Sports team member prior to a conditioning regimen. VO2max may be useful for the right person with the right resources (e.g. a coach or trainer), at the right time (prior to an intervention designed specifically to increase fitness), and with a particular goal in mind (e.g. as a trackable metric during a new conditioning program).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="p-frame-criteria">P-FRAME Criteria</h2>

<p>Several qualitative AND quantitative metrics can be useful for defining the purpose for, and utility of, nearly any biomarker. I’ve selected a few general features a good biomarker should have that I find useful: Predictive, Feasible, Responsive, Actionable, Minimally Invasive, and Explainable (P-FRAME).</p>

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="/assets/img/Biomarker_Radial_Plot.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="600px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

<h4 id="predictive">Predictive</h4>

<p>The essential component of a biomarker—does it predict a particular health/disease state? HbA1c (the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin—that is sugar-modified hemoglobin in your blood) is extremely predictive of future microvascular damage cause by excess blood sugar levels. As a biomarker that can predict diseases such as diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathy, diabetic eye disease (retinopathy), and diabetic kidney disease, HbA1c is the epitome of Predictive.</p>

<h4 id="feasible">Feasible</h4>

<p>A more practical point; can any laboratory or individual measure the biomarker themselves? Biomarkers that have at home test kits (In fact, startup Simple HealthKit just signed a <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/retail/simple-healthkit-inks-deal-walmart-rollback-prices-increase-access-home-test">deal with Walmart</a> to allow for HbA1c home testing!) are quite feasible. Performing a PET/CT scan, which requires injection of a radioisotope and simultaneously imaging of a part of or the whole body in order to see progression of metastatic cancer, is on the opposite end of feasible.</p>

<h4 id="responsive">Responsive</h4>

<p>Does the biomarker respond well to intervention? VO2max is an interesting example. The fitter you are, the higher it is. Rigorous aerobic training in general can increase VO2max quite predictably. In fact, read  <a href="https://brooksleitner.medium.com/the-1977-exercise-protocol-that-increased-fitness-more-than-any-other-8557efa6d929">my previous post</a> dissecting the magnitude of change from the most intense aerobic exercise study I have seen to date. The reason I don’t give it a 5/5 is because it is extremely hard to increase VO2max, particularly without regular measurement and/or with a coach.</p>

<h4 id="actionable">Actionable</h4>

<p>Does a particular biomarker score prompt you with a clear set of actions? Heart rate variability (HRV), which is statistically associated with a beneficial state of recovery, is a very general marker of a health state. Because we don’t fully yet understand the scientific underpinnings, it is hard to have a clear set of actions to take when you receive “74 milliseconds” as your last night’s HRV from your wearable. However, HRV is GENERALLY actionable. That is, a person may adopt generally healthy behaviors, and hope that their HRV responds in a beneficial direction. And maybe that’s enough out of a biomarker! Just not perfect…</p>

<h4 id="minimally-invasive">Minimally Invasive</h4>

<p>The three examples in the graph above demonstrate a decent part of the spectrum here. A completely non-invasive wearable wrist monitor to obtain HRV scores a 5/5. HbA1c requires a small amount of blood which is not horrible, but you may not want to do daily blood draws or needle sticks, and thus scores a 4/5. VO2max requires (in a laboratory setting) attachment to a 10-lead EKG, an extremely strenuous exercise test, all while wearing a facemask that captures your oxygen exchange. Though you don’t need a blood draw, I score it a 3/5 because of how involved it is. Depending on how insightful the biomarker is, you may strike a balance between invasiveness and insight gleaned from the result.</p>

<h4 id="explainable">Explainable</h4>

<p>Explainability is a bonus trait, yet I think being able to explain how the biomarker is causally (or mechanistically) associated with a particular disease/health state is important if the biomarker will stand the test of time. For example, we know that HbA1c reflects glycemic control over the last 90-120 days because the amount of sugar in the serum directly reflects how much glucose binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and the red blood cell lifespan is 90-120 days. We know then, about how long it will take to change HbA1c, and that control of blood sugar each day will impact its result. However, using procalcitonin to guide treatment of a bacterial infection is useful, but it is way less clear WHY it is helpful. Being able to explain WHY a biomarker is useful, gives a lot more credibility and better helps guide management.</p>

<p>The P-FRAME framework is more subjective and qualitative, as metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value are important statistical and quantifiable metrics that are used at a population level. P-FRAME is intended to help an individual (you) assess how a biomarker may be useful, particularly on a per-individual basis.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="specific-indications">Specific Indications</h2>

<p>For the sake of space, I will direct you again to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326791/">NIH’s “BEST Resource”</a> to examine the numerous indications for biomarkers. In general, you can create a biomarker for any purpose, but clearly defined purposes include for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Diagnosis</li>
    <li>Disease/Risk Prediction</li>
    <li>Safety</li>
    <li>Monitoring</li>
    <li>Treatment Response</li>
    <li>Prognosis</li>    
</ul>

<p>There are criteria, along with evidence, that must be met in order for biomarkers to be adopted widely in clinical practice. Typically, the evidence and metrics should be obtained in the context of one or more of the above indications.</p>

<p>Look out for more analyses related to existing, and up and coming biomarkers, and try the P-FRAME framework as you come across new biomarkers. I particularly challenge you to understand the predictability and explainability of them!</p>

Our body is designed to break down the food we ingest into usable energy substrates in order to generate ATP—the molecule of energy currency that fuels nearly all metabolic reactions in our bodies. Now, not all energy that we ingest is “lost,” or expended to perform specific functions that our bodies do. Some of it is used for growth, like how amino acids can become building blocks for muscle through a process called muscle protein synthesis. In addition, energy goes into assisting growth of reproductive cells and tissues. However, the majority of the energy we take in is lost through a variety of processes, all cumulatively known as “Energy Expenditure.”</p>

    The Components of Energy Intake and Expenditure Have Numerous Derivatives
</div>

<p>The largest component of energy expenditure is your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR is the energy that your body uses to maintain basic housekeeping functions, like fueling the Na+/K+ ATPase that maintains cellular gradients at the molecular level, and fueling your always pumping heart, energy-utilizing brain, etc… BMR is most largely determined by your lean body mass (your organs and skeletal muscles). Use the BMR calculator below to estimate your basal metabolic rate!</p>

<p>Then, there are several more easily modifiable components of energy expenditure:</p>

<p>Physical activity: intensity, duration, and type of exercise can all influence how much energy is required for physical activity</p>

<p>Thermic effect of food: Energy is consumed simply digesting the food you take in. It is approximately 10% of the calories that you eat in a normal day. Proteins have higher thermic effects of food, and simple sugars have the smallest thermic effect of food.</p>

<p>Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): This is the extra amount of energy you expend as you tap your foot, get dressed in the morning, and brush your teeth. Small movements that all add up throughout the day to become a component of your overall energy expenditure.</p>

<p>This calculator was based off of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation">Harris-Benedict Formula</a>. Of note, this is an equation based on population averages, and is not very sensitive to differences in body composition (ie. How much fat versus muscle you have at a given weight). Multiple corrections have been made over the years in the academic literature, but this formula provides a reasonable estimate for you to base the largest component of your energy expenditure!</p>

Interestingly, ketamine has shown preliminary efficacy for numerous conditions related to chronic pain, anesthesia, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple mental health conditions including depression, PTSD, and opioid use disorder and researchers want to understand how it’s working. I am most interested in it’s role in mental health conditions, and I recently participated in one of these trials to help understand the how the doses used for treatment-resistant depression might be working to modulate brain metabolism. This study, by the way, requires clean urinalyses so that researchers can be sure there are no confounding influences from other drugs, including cannabis.</p>

<p>So, I underwent two MR (magnetic resonance) imaging scans (one day with placebo, one day with ketamine infusion), and I did not know which day I would be experiencing ketamine. On the first day, I was waiting for any odd sensations. Other than questioning the curtains’ movement as they were measuring my blood pressure and performing an EKG in the recovery room, I would find it hard to believe that Ketamine had any psychedelic effects if I did have it.</p>

<p>On Day 2, about 5 minutes into the beginning of the infusion while I was lying awake inside the MR scanner, my first thought was: “wow, okay last week was definitely the placebo.” I broke down my experience into three distinct phases (that I remembered) just a few hours after the experience:</p>

<p>Phase 1: “Going Down”</p>

<p>While lying the in the scanner with an IV placed in each arm (one for blood samples and the other for the ketamine infusion), a blood pressure cuff on my right leg, and a pulse oximeter on my left toe, I began to experience in interesting feeling of comfort. Like I was being fully swaddled as my body experienced a sort of heaviness and warmth. I felt as if my body was slowly falling through an ocean (it felt more like falling through a liquid, not quite air), and drifting down for what seemed like a very long time. I just kept going down further, all the while in a state of comfort and relaxation. At some point throughout this journey, however, I found myself questioning whether or not I was physically falling. I remember testing to ensure I could still wiggle my fingers. I then recall telling myself “I’m safe, I’m safe.” I can’t recall ever stopping this journey, but I then experienced my second phase.</p>

<p>Phase 2: “What are those squiggly lines?”</p>

    Ketamine Phase 2 depiction of my potential "confrontation with my subconscious"
</div>

<p>It started with those squiggly colorful lines that you see when you close your eyes after looking at something bright. Vague lines and shapes, that don’t exactly form anything you can make sense of. I watched these vague lines for a while, just the same way that you might if you’re in a room on your own with nowhere to be, and just looked at them. After some amount of time, after I realized they weren’t magically going to form some object that gave me an epiphany, I began to try to understand what they may be. I wondered if they represented something in my subconscious, as perhaps my Phase 1 journey was taking me exactly there. As the blood pressure cuff went off during that time, I snapped back to my clinical reality momentarily. But only after I began to realize that if I thought hard enough about what those figures may be, I may just have experienced something amazing. Then I entered my final phase.</p>

<p>Phase 3: The Roller Coaster Back to Reality</p>

    Ketamine Phase 3 depiction of me riding a roller coaster with a king cobra as the roller coaster cars.
</div>

<p>This is when the nurse, who accompanied me during the entire 3-hour imaging study, told me that I told her “I am so ***** high.” I was experiencing intense waves of sensation throughout my body, most similar to what you feel when you ride a winding roller coaster at Six Flags for the first time. I imagined that I was dipping back down to the bottom of Phase 1, and back up to reality. For whatever reason, I envisioned that I was no longer swaddled, but rather on the back of the wide neck of a king cobra. I didn’t actually ~see~ the cobra, but its what I felt like I was on. Semi-scary, but finally the phase that I associated with “tripping.” At the end of this phase, I slowly began to hear the humming of the scanner in the background. The nurse telling me that it had been 37 minutes since the start of the infusion. Then eventually, it just felt like my first day in the study again…</p>

<p>For the remaining 80 minutes inside of the MR scanner, I began to realize the potential utility of this treatment for people with persistent intrusive or distorted thoughts. Was Phase 2 the place where a person could confront their subconscious and work through it? Importantly, I realized that an epiphany was unlikely to come passively; if I were to overcome a challenging part of my previously subconscious reality, I would have to put effort into what my mental difficulties were. Ideally, I imagine, I would have prepared in the first place while in therapy with a psychologist or psychiatrist so that I could go into my Ketamine experience ready to address these subconscious thoughts.</p>

<p>I also wondered whether I would have any visual hallucinations during this experience. I did not, and I would agree that my experience aligns well with ketamine’s label as a “dissociative” agent. There were times I felt that my body experienced things, but not necessarily that I was the one experiencing them.</p>

<p>In summary, having experienced the psychedelic first-hand, I will be very interested to understand its role in clinical practice for mental health conditions and beyond. I believe there is certainly utility for the right person: someone whose thoughts are pervasive, but they have difficulty overcoming them in the moment. Further, these will be patients who are motivated to seek out the underlying issues and confront them. Gamechanger? Perhaps. But like all treatments, pharmacological or not, there will need to be buy in (belief it will work!) from both the practitioner and the patient and also fit the needs of patient at that given time.</p>
