We take in energy in the form of the three macronutrients: carbohydrates, fatty acids, and proteins. Our body is designed to break down the food we ingest into usable energy substrates in order to generate ATP—the molecule of energy currency that fuels nearly all metabolic reactions in our bodies. Now, not all energy that we ingest is “lost,” or expended to perform specific functions that our bodies do. Some of it is used for growth, like how amino acids can become building blocks for muscle through a process called muscle protein synthesis. In addition, energy goes into assisting growth of reproductive cells and tissues. However, the majority of the energy we take in is lost through a variety of processes, all cumulatively known as “Energy Expenditure.”

The largest component of energy expenditure is your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your BMR is the energy that your body uses to maintain basic housekeeping functions, like fueling the Na+/K+ ATPase that maintains cellular gradients at the molecular level, and fueling your always pumping heart, energy-utilizing brain, etc… BMR is most largely determined by your lean body mass (your organs and skeletal muscles). Use the BMR calculator below to estimate your basal metabolic rate!

Then, there are several more easily modifiable components of energy expenditure:    

Physical activity: intensity, duration, and type of exercise can all influence how much energy is required for physical activity

Thermic effect of food: Energy is consumed simply digesting the food you take in. It is approximately 10% of the calories that you eat in a normal day. Proteins have higher thermic effects of food, and simple sugars have the smallest thermic effect of food.

Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT): This is the extra amount of energy you expend as you tap your foot, get dressed in the morning, and brush your teeth. Small movements that all add up throughout the day to become a component of your overall energy expenditure.

BMR Calculator:

This calculator was based off of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris–Benedict_equation">Harris-Benedict Formula</a>. Of note, this is an equation based on population averages, and is not very sensitive to differences in body composition (ie. How much fat versus muscle you have at a given weight). Multiple corrections have been made over the years in the academic literature, but this formula provides a reasonable estimate for you to base the largest component of your energy expenditure!
