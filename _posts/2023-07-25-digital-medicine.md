Digital Medicine describes a novel approach to medical therapy using software and technology as therapeutics. Two videos cover the concept of why do we need, and why is now the time for digital medicine, and also the current state of affairs-- challenges and successes-- of implementing these strategies.

The American healthcare system, largely designed when infectious diseases were the leading cause of mortality, is struggling to combat the chronic disease epidemic. Though it is easy to criticize, it is difficult to come up with solutions to improve chronic disease management.

In this first video I cover a great review <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3495">article</a> on Digital Medicine as a potential solution to the chronic disease epidemic. The authors argue WHY now is the time to implement a novel solution.

In the second video, I describe the definitions related to digital medicine. These are important for the associated policy implications, as organizations are lobbying to expand medicare and medicaid coverage of digital medicines.
