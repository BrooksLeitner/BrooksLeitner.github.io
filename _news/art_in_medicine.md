With the help of AI digital art creation tools, I was able to create "Intensive Care," a piece born out of my reflections on the intersection of critical illness, ICU technology, and the interconnectedness of the body. This was judged as 2nd place in the Art category of the Yale School of Medicine competition.

Here is a small blurb that I presented at the award ceremony: "Modern medicine has enabled us to prolong life and prevent mortality in settings of extreme illness. As I observed patients in the surgical and medical intensive care units during my 3rd year clerkships, I saw medicines, machines, lines, and more that took over every critical bodily function of our patients, with the goal of supporting the ability to treat underlying causes like infections or trauma. As I looked at these patients hooked up to these machines, in settings of Intensive Care, I had many thoughts. Will they ever return to the same quality of life they had before this? Are these machines truly temporary extensions of human physiology? Like many patientsâ€™ families, I thought, how much does all this cost? As I worked on Intensive Care, I wanted to depict the interconnectedness of all our organs, but also the extension of the vessels that connect our organs to intricate machinery. Ultimately, I found myself truly envisioning the lines blurring between natural and artificial human physiology. I hope that this portrayal of Intensive Care evokes similar feelings of awe, uncertainty, and even uneasiness, that I felt when helping perform neurological exams on the Neurology Consult Service on patients in the ICU."
