	abstract = {Human brown adipose tissue (BAT) can be activated to increase glucose uptake and energy expenditure, making it a potential target for treating obesity and metabolic disease. Data on the functional and anatomic characteristics of BAT are limited, however. In 20 healthy young men [12 lean, mean body mass index (BMI) 23.2 ± 1.9 kg/m2; 8 obese, BMI 34.8 ± 3.3 kg/m2] after 5 h of tolerable cold exposure, we measured BAT volume and activity by 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT). Obese men had less activated BAT than lean men (mean, 130 vs. 334 mL) but more fat in BAT-containing depots (mean, 1,646 vs. 855 mL) with a wide range (0.1–71\%) in the ratio of activated BAT to inactive fat between individuals. Six anatomic regions had activated BAT—cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, paraspinal, and abdominal—with 67 ± 20\% of all activated BAT concentrated in a continuous fascial layer comprising the first three depots in the upper torso. These nonsubcutaneous fat depots amounted to 1.5\% of total body mass (4.3\% of total fat mass), and up to 90\% of each depot could be activated BAT. The amount and activity of BAT was significantly influenced by region of interest selection methods, PET threshold criteria, and PET resolutions. The present study suggests that active BAT can be found in specific adipose depots in adult humans, but less than one-half of the fat in these depots is stimulated by acute cold exposure, demonstrating a previously underappreciated thermogenic potential.},

	abstract = {Despite interest in exercise as a treatment for anxiety disorders the mechanism behind the anxiolytic effects of exercise is unclear. Two observations motivate the present work. First, engagement of attention control during increased working memory (WM) load can decrease anxiety. Second, exercise can improve attention control. Therefore, exercise could boost the anxiolytic effects of increased WM load via its strengthening of attention control. Anxiety was induced by threat of shock and was quantified with anxiety-potentiated startle (APS). Thirty-five healthy volunteers (19 male, age M = 26.11, SD = 5.52) participated in two types of activity, exercise (biking at 60–70\% of heart rate reserve) and control-activity (biking at 10–20\% of heart rate reserve). After each activity, participants completed a WM task (n-back) at low- and high-load during safe and threat. Results were not consistent with the hypothesis: exercise vs. control-activity increased APS in high-load (p = .03). However, this increased APS was not accompanied with threat-induced impairment in WM performance (p = .37). Facilitation of both task-relevant stimulus processing and task-irrelevant threat processing, concurrent with prevention of threat interference on cognition, suggests that exercise increases cognitive ability. Future studies should explore how exercise affects the interplay of cognition and anxiety in patients with anxiety disorders.},

However, rodent studies suggest that these drugs could have other beneficial effects on human metabolism. We performed tissue receptor profiling and showed that the human β3-AR mRNA is also highly expressed in gallbladder and brown adipose tissue (BAT). We next studied the clinical implications of this distribution in twelve healthy men given one-time randomized doses of placebo; the approved dose of 50 mg; and 200 mg of the β3-AR agonist mirabegron. There was a more-than-dose proportional increase in BAT metabolic activity as measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT (medians 0.0 vs. 18.2 vs. 305.6 mL*SUVmean*g/mL). Only the 200 mg dose elevated both non-esterified fatty acids (+68\%) and resting energy expenditure (+5.8\%). Previously undescribed increases in gallbladder size (+35\%) and reductions in conjugated bile acids were also discovered. Therefore, besides urinary bladder relaxation, the human β3-AR contributes to WAT lipolysis, BAT thermogenesis, gallbladder relaxation, and bile acid metabolism. This physiology should be considered in the development of more selective β3-AR agonists to treat obesity-related complications.},

	abstract = {While endurance exercise training improves cerebrovascular health and has neurotrophic effects within the hippocampus, the effects of stopping this exercise on the brain remain unclear. Our aim was to measure the effects of 10 days of detraining on resting cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in gray matter and the hippocampus in healthy and physically fit older adults. We hypothesized that rCBF would decrease in the hippocampus after a 10-day cessation of exercise training. Twelve master athletes, defined as older adults (age ≥ 50 years) with long-term endurance training histories (≥ 15 years), were recruited from local running clubs. After screening, eligible participants were asked to cease all training and vigorous physical activity for 10 consecutive days. Before and immediately after the exercise cessation period, rCBF was measured with perfusion-weighted MRI. A voxel-wise analysis was used in gray matter, and the hippocampus was selected a priori as a structurally defined region of interest, to detect rCBF changes over time. Resting CBF significantly decreased in eight gray matter brain regions. These regions included: (L) inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, (R) cerebellar tonsil, lingual gyrus, precuneus, and bilateral cerebellum (FWE p {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, rCBF within the left and right hippocampus significantly decreased after 10 days of no exercise training. These findings suggest that the cerebrovascular system, including the regulation of resting hippocampal blood flow, is responsive to short-term decreases in exercise training among master athletes. Cessation of exercise training among physically fit individuals may provide a novel method to assess the effects of acute exercise and exercise training on brain function in older adults.},

	abstract = {Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been identified as a potential target in the treatment and prevention of obesity and metabolic disease. The precise kinetics of BAT activation and the duration of stimulus required to recruit metabolically active BAT, and its subsequent deactivation, are not well-understood. In this clinical trial, 19 healthy adults (BMI: 23.7 ± 0.7 kg/m2, Age: 31.2 ± 2.8 year, 12 female) underwent three different cooling procedures to stimulate BAT glucose uptake, and active BAT volume was determined using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT imaging. We found that 20 min of pre-injection cooling produces activation similar to the standard 60 min (39.9 mL vs. 44.2 mL, p = 0.52), indicating that BAT activity approaches its peak function soon after the initiation of cooling. Furthermore, upon removal of cold exposure, active BAT volume declines (13.6 mL vs. 44.2 mL, p = 0.002), but the deactivation process persists even hours following cessation of cooling. Thus, the kinetics of human BAT thermogenesis are characterized by a rapid increase soon after cold stimulation but a more gradual decline after rewarming. These characteristics reinforce the feasibility of developing mild, short-duration cold exposure to activate BAT and treat obesity and metabolic disease.},

This study examines the influence of exercise in healthy controls on two distinct defensive states implicated in anxiety disorders: fear, a phasic response to a predictable threat, and anxiety, a sustained response to an unpredictable threat. Methods Thirty?four healthy volunteers (17 male, age M = 26.18, SD = 5.6) participated in sessions of exercise (biking at 60?70\% of heart rate reserve) and control (biking at 10?20\% of heart rate reserve) activity for 30 min, separated by 1 week. Threat responses were measured by eyeblink startle and assessed with the ?Neutral?Predictable?Unpredictable threat test,? which includes a neutral (N) and two threat conditions, one with predictable (P) and one with unpredictable (U) shock. Results Results show that exercise versus control activity reduces startle potentiation during unpredictable threat (P = .031), but has no effect on startle potentiation during predictable threat (P = .609). Conclusions These results suggest that exercise reduces defensive response to unpredictable, but not predictable, threat, a dissociation that may help inform clinical indications for this behavioral intervention, as well as provide clues to its underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms.},

BAT's ability to expend energy has made it a potential target for novel therapies to ameliorate obesity and associated metabolic disorders in humans. Though this tissue has been well studied in small animals, BAT's thermogenic capacity in humans remains largely unknown due to the difficulties of measuring its volume, activity, and distribution. Identifying and quantifying active human BAT is commonly performed using 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scans following cold-exposure or pharmacological activation. Here we describe a detailed image-analysis approach to quantify total-body human BAT from 18F-FDG PET/CT scans using an open-source software. We demonstrate the drawing of user-specified regions of interest to identify metabolically active adipose tissue while avoiding common non-BAT tissues, to measure BAT volume and activity, and to further characterize its anatomical distribution. Although this rigorous approach is time-consuming, we believe it will ultimately provide a foundation to develop future automated BAT quantification algorithms.},

Methods BAT volume and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake were measured by positron emission tomography and computerized tomography in 12 women and 12 men (BMI 18.5-25 kg/m2, aged 18-35 years) after 5 hours of exposure to their coldest temperature before overt shivering. Results Women had a lower detectable BAT volume than men (P = 0.03), but there was no difference after normalizing to body size. The mean BAT glucose uptake and relative distribution of BAT did not differ by sex. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake consistent with BAT was observed in superficial dorsocervical adipose tissue of 6 of 12 women but only 1 of 12 men (P = 0.02). This potential BAT depot would pose fewer biopsy risks than other depots. Conclusions Despite differences in adiposity and total BAT volume, we found that healthy, lean, young women and men do not differ in the relative amount, glucose uptake, and distribution of BAT. Dorsocervical 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was more prevalent in women and may be a remnant of interscapular BAT seen in human newborns.

	abstract = {Immunometabolism within the tumor microenvironment is an appealing target for precision therapy approaches in lung cancer. Interestingly, obesity confers an improved response to immune checkpoint inhibition in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting intriguing relationships between systemic metabolism and the immunometabolic environment in lung tumors. We hypothesized that visceral fat and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake influenced the tumor immunometabolic environment and that these bidirectional relationships differ in NSCLC subtypes, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). By integrating 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging, bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, and histology, we observed that LUSC had a greater dependence on glucose than LUAD. In LUAD tumors with high glucose uptake, glutaminase was downregulated, suggesting a tradeoff between glucose and glutamine metabolism, while in LUSC tumors with high glucose uptake, genes related to fatty acid and amino acid metabolism were also increased. We found that tumor-infiltrating T cells had the highest expression of glutaminase, ribosomal protein 37, and cystathionine gamma-lyase in NSCLC, highlighting the metabolic flexibility of this cell type. Further, we demonstrate that visceral adiposity, but not body mass index (BMI), was positively associated with tumor glucose uptake in LUAD and that patients with high BMI had favorable prognostic transcriptional profiles, while tumors of patients with high visceral fat had poor prognostic gene expression. We posit that metabolic adjunct therapy may be more successful in LUSC rather than LUAD due to LUAD’s metabolic flexibility and that visceral adiposity, not BMI alone, should be considered when developing precision medicine approaches for the treatment of NSCLC.},

	abstract = {Mobilization of glycogen, the short-term storage form of glucose, is the body's first defense against hypoglycemia and is critical for energy provision during high intensity exercise. Therefore, to advance metabolic research, it is critical to be able to accurately measure glycogen concentrations, including during a prolonged fast and other glycogen-modulating interventions. Unfortunately, prior enzymatic methods of glycogen detection have been plagued by poor detection in the lower range, high sample mass requirements, and complicated and/or expensive protocols which introduce substantial technical variability into the measured glycogen concentrations. To address these limitations, here we report a streamlined and versatile glycogen extraction protocol coupled with an optimized phenol-sulfuric acid quantification protocol. With this method, we demonstrate how glycogen can be extracted from only 20 mg of tissue with one centrifugation step and quantified with a highly precise (Intra-assay \%CV ranges from 5–10\%) and sensitive (proportionality constant for glycogen = 0.07279 A.U./µg) assay. The cost of all materials equates to 10 cents per sample. Therefore, this method represents an attractive means of assessing ex vivo tissue glycogen content including at the extremes of glycogen concentrations.},

Data were analyzed between February 18, 2020, and March 4, 2021.Enrolled trainees at specific stages of medical training.The primary outcome was the odds of representation of American Indian and Alaska Native individuals at successive academic medical stages in 2018-2019 compared with White individuals. Secondary outcomes comprised specialty-specific proportions of American Indian and Alaska Native residents from 2011 to 2020 and medical specialty–specific proportions of American Indian and Alaska Native physicians in 2018. Fisher exact tests were performed to calculate the odds of American Indian and Alaska Native representation at successive stages of medical training. Simple linear regressions were performed to assess trends across residency specialties.The study data contained a total of 238 974 607 White and American Indian and Alaska Native US citizens, 24 795 US medical school applicants, 11 242 US medical school acceptees, 10 822 US medical school matriculants, 10 917 US medical school graduates, 59 635 residents, 518 874 active physicians, and 113 168 US medical school faculty. American Indian and Alaska Native individuals had a 63\% lower odds of applying to medical school (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.45) and 48\% lower odds of holding a full-time faculty position (OR, 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.44-0.62) compared with their White counterparts, yet had 54\% higher odds of working in a residency specialty deemed as a priority by the Indian Health Service (OR, 1.54; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.16). Of the 33 physician specialties analyzed, family medicine (0.55\%) and pain medicine (0.46\%) had more than an average proportion (0.41\%) of American Indian and Alaska Native physicians compared with their representation across all specialties.This cross-sectional study noted 2 distinct stages in medical training with significantly lower representation of American Indian and Alaska Native compared with White individuals. An actionable framework to guide academic medical institutions on their Indigenous diversification and inclusivity efforts is proposed.},

Due to the inherent subjectivity of pain perception, assessment and management, physician-patient bias in pain medicine remains widespread. It is broadly accepted that increasing racial diversity in the field of medicine is a critical step towards addressing persistent inequities in patient care. To assess the current racial demographics of the pain medicine pipeline, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of medical school matriculants and graduates, residents, and pain fellows in 2018. Our results show that the 2018 anesthesiology residency ERAS applicant pool consisted of 46.2\% non-Hispanic White, 7.0\% non-Hispanic Black and 5.8\% Hispanic students. The population of 2018 anesthesiology residents included 63\% non-Hispanic White, 6.8\% non-Hispanic Black and 5.4\% Hispanic persons. Of the total eligible resident pool for pain fellowships (n = 30,415) drawn from core specialties, 44\% were non-Hispanic White, 4.9\% non-Hispanic Black and 5.1\% Hispanic. Similar proportions were observed for pain medicine and regional anesthesia fellows. We briefly discuss the implications of the shortage of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic representation in pain medicine as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest approaches to improving these disparities.},

More recently, with obesity rates rising in the U.S. and worldwide, epidemiologic evidence has supported a link between obesity and cancer. A substantial body of work seeks to mechanistically unpack the association between obesity, altered metabolism, and cancer. Without question, these relationships are multifactorial and cannot be distilled to a single obesity- and metabolism-altering hormone, substrate, or factor. However, it is important to understand the hormone-specific associations between metabolism and cancer. Here, we review the links between obesity, metabolic dysregulation, insulin, and cancer, with an emphasis on current investigational metabolic adjuncts to standard-of-care cancer treatment.},

The pathophysiological hallmark of PASC is characterized by impaired system oxygen extraction (EO2) on invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test (iCPET). However, the mechanistic insights into impaired EO2 remain unclear. We studied 21 consecutive iCPET in PASC patients with unexplained exertional intolerance. PASC patients were dichotomized into mildly reduced (EO2peak-mild) and severely reduced (EO2peak-severe) EO2 groups according to the median peak EO2 value. Proteomic profiling was performed on mixed venous blood plasma obtained at peak exercise during iCPET. PASC patients as a group exhibited depressed peak exercise aerobic capacity (peak VO2; 85 ± 18 vs. 131 ± 45\% predicted; p = 0.0002) with normal systemic oxygen delivery, DO2 (37 ± 9 vs. 42 ± 15 mL/kg/min; p = 0.43) and reduced EO2 (0.4 ± 0.1 vs. 0.8 ± 0.1; p {\textless} 0.0001). PASC patients with EO2peak-mild exhibited greater DO2 compared to those with EO2peak-severe [42.9 (34.2–41.2) vs. 32.1 (26.8–38.0) mL/kg/min; p = 0.01]. The proteins with increased expression in the EO2peak-severe group were involved in inflammatory and fibrotic processes. In the EO2peak-mild group, proteins associated with oxidative phosphorylation and glycogen metabolism were elevated. In PASC patients with impaired EO2, there exist a spectrum of PASC phenotype related to differential aberrant protein expression and cardio-pulmonary physiologic response. PASC patients with EO2peak-severe exhibit a maladaptive physiologic and proteomic signature consistent with persistent inflammatory state and endothelial dysfunction, while in the EO2peak-mild group, there is enhanced expression of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation-mediated ATP synthesis along with an enhanced cardiopulmonary physiological response.},

	abstract = {Metabolic scaling, the inverse correlation of metabolic rates to body mass, has been appreciated for more than 80 years. Studies of metabolic scaling have largely been restricted to mathematical modeling of caloric intake and oxygen consumption, and mostly rely on computational modeling. The possibility that other metabolic processes scale with body size has not been comprehensively studied. To address this gap in knowledge, we employed a systems approach including transcriptomics, proteomics, and measurement of in vitro and in vivo metabolic fluxes. Gene expression in livers of five species spanning a 30,000-fold range in mass revealed differential expression according to body mass of genes related to cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic processes, and to detoxication of oxidative damage. To determine whether flux through key metabolic pathways is ordered inversely to body size, we applied stable isotope tracer methodology to study multiple cellular compartments, tissues, and species. Comparing C57BL/6 J mice with Sprague-Dawley rats, we demonstrate that while ordering of metabolic fluxes is not observed in in vitro cell-autonomous settings, it is present in liver slices and in vivo. Together, these data reveal that metabolic scaling extends beyond oxygen consumption to other aspects of metabolism, and is regulated at the level of gene and protein expression, enzyme activity, and substrate supply.},
